The lessons were easy to understand and easy to teach. Each lesson has a list up front explaining everything you need for the session. This alone is very helpful.<br /><br />As for the lessons, the students in my Sunday School class (11th and 12th graders) are being challenged by new ideas and thoughts. This has led them to really look at their faith and figure out what they truly believe. This alone is essential to them establishing a personal faith and not cling to the faith of their parents.<br /><br />This curriculum is essential to any youth group. They are topics that should be discussed with every senior before they leave high school.<br /><br />How could you pass up on such a formational curriculum for such a great price?<br /><br />- Zach Carpenter<br />Roseburg Church On The Rise	2012-05-03

It was fun going hearing about Mr. Bryan's sexual escapades -- at first.  It was refreshing to have someone who could frequently be very perceptive speak honestly not only about his life, but the sexual escapades and shenanigans he was engaging in.  And to link that behavior with the horrific conditions of his early youth in a ghetto in Jamaica, and more loosely, with the Jamaican cultural socialization which influenced him.  These elements humanized and explained some of his less than noble behavior.<br /><br />However, what becomes extremely obvious as the book goes on (and on and on it does go)is that, even in Mr. Bryan's own words, he suffers from 'dissocial personality disorder,' or some such thing.  Perilously close, it seems to me, to sociopathic behavior.  Even the title, in retrospect, speaks to the sociopaths view of humanity.  Mr. Bryan is a 'passenger', i.e. a person, the woman are 'cabs' -- non-humans.<br /><br />The irony, of course, for anyone who's read the novel is that Mr. Bryan frequently speaks of how the Japanese culture traumatizes and demeans women.  However, he is a flagrant abuser of women -- though he frequently presents himself as the opposite, as one who has nutured these poor women back to health!<br /><br />He has impregnated more than 10 women while in Japan -- and in most case paid or helped to pay for the abortions.  More than 10 women!  All because he enjoys the feel of sex without a condom.  And because he knows that most of the women won't insist that he wear one due to their timidity!  So, in effect, he'd have woman after woman go through the greater trauma of an abortion; and have fetus be terminated (some would even say murdered); and he would even have to pay (in some cases only half) for his temporary pleasure!  This, more than ten times!<br /><br />And let us not forget how he then has his cake and eats it too as he makes out how horrible it is of the Japanese to run an abortion industry, instead of having oral contraceptives more readily available.<br /><br />He also even refers to the women in his writings as cars.  He prefers, he tells the reader, his \\"bentley\\" (Shoko) but the 'ferrari' (Azusa) is sexier and her parents are so accepting of him!<br /><br />The language he uses time and again, in conjunction with the repeated behaviors, indicates that closeness he shares with the sociopath: people are things to be used, manipulated.  People are not people: they are not truly human with feelings and the right to be treated as 'ends in themselves' -- but rather they are trappings, are thigns, to be used and manipulated by the sociopath.<br /><br />Mr. Bryan frequently talks about how he doesn't really love -- indeed, it seems that he doesn't even like very much -- Azusa.  But she's so good looking that he wants to have children with her; while, of course, marrying Shoko (or perhaps converting to Islam -- though he's an atheist -- in the hopes of being able to legally marry both of them).<br /><br />This goes on and on.<br /><br />Again, at first, much of this seemed fun, interesting, a man with hardbreaks coming into his own.  However, this behavior is -- and has been -- going on for years, even into his forites.<br /><br />Yes, there's the 'addiction,' however, I got the distinct impression that Mr. Bryan was being more honest than perhaps he meant to be when he on repeated occasions told the reader about his personality disorder.  He truly has one, it seems.  He may not be a sociopath, but in many respects his 'disorder' is such that other people are things.  For me, to get behind the eyes, so to speak, of a person like that is a frightening experience.  But, pun intended, an 'eye-opener'!<br /><br />It's also curious that Mr. Bryan has, it seems, only female friends.  In part, he would have the reader believe it is because of his greater sensitivity to females and their plight.  He sometimes refers to himself as a 'lesbian in a male's body.'  His sensitivity is hogwash!  Woman form the perfect dovetail for the likes of him:  one, he likes 'tail' and two, he knows that he can manipulate them far more easily than he can men.  These two features make them delectable to him.<br /><br />A minor note.  Much of the book is fairly well written with this curious feature:  there are numerous rather 'lofty' words sprinkled throughout the text.  For example he writes of one woman \\"she tried corybanticly to cloak herself with anything in sight\\" (Yukari; p331).  Now, I have a master's degree in English, but I don't know what the freak \\"corybanticly\\" means.  The point is that too frequently this text is larded with extremely high falutin words, amid, of course, the booty calls, and his petrified rod, etc.<br /><br />Most curious!<br /><br />Anyway, this is in many ways an interesting read: some of the incidents are enjoyable to read; much of the writing is actually pretty good; there are some sharp insights into Japanese culture ( I lived in Japan for a year so I had some access to what he's referring to); there's great awareness generally of culture and its influence (Jamaican, American, Japanese).  There's the fascinating other perspective -- both replusive and fascinating -- of the view from the 'personality disorder'.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this book 3 stars.<br /><br />I hope this review helped.<br /><br />Aloha,<br />paul	2012-05-03

A further entrant to the popular range of recipe books by the BBC now provides 101 additional cakes and bakes that could add a few kilos or more without trouble to your waistline... and since the recipes look so easy to make as well one cannot rely upon prevarication to help reduce calorific intake.<br />These praiseworthy little books feature the recipe on one side and a full colour photograph on the facing page, put together into a tight little package that gives 101 different dishes for an unbeatable price.<br />Reviewing these books is actually quite hard. One cannot be critical of the approach taken by the entire series as there is nothing that can go wrong (doing a \\"King Alfred\\" not withstanding). . One cannot complain about the breadth of recipes, the price, the appearance, so one might be forced to complain about the sheer tempting nature of the recipes if one has to find something to complain about.<br />Split into six sections - large cakes, fresh fruit cakes, chocolate cakes and bakes, loaf cakes, small cakes and tray bakes and finally muffins and cookies - and backed up by a good little index you can, at-a-glance dig out that favourite recipe, find inspiration based on a particular ingredient or, of course, just browse through and be inspired.<br />Each recipe has even been \\"triple tested\\" by different cooks to ensure that the average home cook will have no problems, something some other cook books could well emulate. So far we have not found a bad book in this series and long may it continue.	2012-05-03

Without those you might just have a \\"smokey hole\\".<br />Here the book tends to assume that you might be looking to also kill your own food and prepare it for eventual smoking, but if the nearest you get to a hunt is looking for a good deal at the supermarket you may need to skip a few pages. It remains important, however, to read about the ideal type of ingredients so that you are able to understand exactly what will work well and what will turn out bad.<br />After you have your ingredients at hand - however you acquired them - there is still preparation to do through the brining (salting) process and you are given expert guidance on this important stage as, if you don't do it right, you will only end up disappointed later on.  Ah, but you might not have any smoking equipment! Fear not, as you are helped look at possible equipment purchases to best determine what you might need.  There is a solution for all.<br />Those thinking of setting up a commercial operation can also benefit from this book as, on the whole, it is just a question of scale. Some separate sections on business-related affairs are included but it is also wise to check your country's own specific requirements prior to making any investment for fairly obvious reasons.<br />Hurrah... now it is time to smoke and there are COPIOUS hints, tips and advice about smoking techniques and specific methods for a very wide range of ingredients.  One thing food smokers also like to do is experiment by changing different fire/smoke sources, spicings and the like. Once you have managed the basics you can either stick to that and have a good consistent product or, of course, maybe try something different for a bit of fun and be possibly surprised with the end results.<br />Despite the comparative age of this book and some of the information that might be \\"out of date\\" or \\"not applicable\\" to your locality, the core of this book remains as consistent and relevant today as on the day it was published.  Even if you have not considered smoking your own food but enjoy smoked food, this book will still provide a lot of useful background information to help you understand more about the art of food smoking.<br />It would have been nice to have had some colour illustrations showing the smoking process and, of course, typical end results.

Yet the apple is an often under-estimated ingredient in cooking, despite its versatility in both food and drink affairs.<br />This \\"Favourite Apple Recipes\\" book is another in a long series of pocket-sized and friendly books that feature many oft-forgotten, uncommon English recipes, This modest 48 page tome features 34 diverse apple recipes ranging from old favourites such as an apple crumble and apple pudding to more rarified delights such as apple gingerbread, apple and potato cake or even an apple, raisin and cider tea bread.<br />One can surely state that there will be at least a few recipes that you've never heard of, let alone tried before. Yet one does not need to be a kitchen genius to try these recipes, each featured on their own page, as despite the lack of food illustrations one gets sufficient information from the concise, to-the-point instructions.  A very brief history or explanation about the dish's development is provided as well for the curious.<br />As with other books in this series, one does not even have to plan to cook the various recipes in order to benefit from it as the timeless sepia images of rural England can provide a dreamy excursion back to a more innocent age.  But you would be advised to don your apron and prove to yourself that the humble apple is, in fact, a versatile beast.	2012-05-03

By Den Adler<br /><br />Finding--and buying--this book was one of the highlights of my recent trip to Arizona to visit a long-time friend. I finally got to put the book down yesterday--when I finished it after reading almost nothing else for several days. A year after her beloved grandmother Elsie died, Barb Waite discovered the diary Elsie kept while teaching in Arizona from 1913 to 1916. To her credit, Barb didn't just read the diary and put it away. She looked further, and found newspaper clippings and even some of Elsie's early students from her one year in Cornville. They, after 75 years, still remembered Elsie and told Barb more stories about her.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit that as a guy Elsie's pretty face on the cover caught my attention, but so did the intelligent, intense look on her face--a sort of \\"Okay, let's get going\\" look. Also, 1916 is mentioned--the year my late father was born. I collect vintage postcards, and the years 1913 to 1916 were during the Golden Age of Postcards--when \\"postals\\" were the emails of that era. Knowing how people lived then helps me appreciate the cards--and their messages--that I have in my collection. I loved Elsie's mother advising her to send \\"postals\\" rather than write letters until her (Elsie's) sore, tired eyes recovered.<br /><br />Elsie wrote only a few lines a day in her diary, but sent and received long, detailed letters. She and her mother kept those letters, and we get to read them here, thanks to the author. Great stuff for anyone interested in life at the beginning of the last century, when \\"creek up\\" meant no delivery of eagerly awaited letters and when cars were still curiosities and travel by horse and train was common. Interest in this book should carry far beyond Arizona. It's a true story of real people living in an era long gone from the U.S., but also a story of love--with its hopes, doubts, fears, and strong emotions--that is repeated, in one way or another, in all of us. This is a wonderful book, andrather than give my copy to my sister, I'll buy her her own.<br /><br />Den Adler, author of \\"To Become a Priest--a Love Story\\"	2012-05-03

It exists and children's librarians know to fear it. At a certain time of year a child will approach the reference desk and utter the dreaded words, \\"I have to read an autobiography of somebody famous\\". Never mind that while biographies are plentiful, good autobiographies come out once in a blue moon and, when they are written for kids, tend to be about children's authors anyway (See: Jack Gantos, Beverly Cleary, Jerry Spinelli, Walter Dean Myers, Jean Fritz, etc.). If a kid wants somebody famous in a field other than writing, the pickings are slim. You might find a good Ruby Bridges book or [[ASIN:0689867476 To Dance]] by Siena Siegel or that children's autobiography Rosa Parks wrote. Beyond that, you're on your own. It is thereofre with great relief that we come across Chuck Close: Face Book. Sure, I'm relieved that at long last there's an autobiography for kids by someone outside the children's literary sphere, but what really thrills me is the sheer splendor of the thing. Chock full of gorgeous full-color reproductions of Close's work and biographical info, the real treat is at the center of the book. It's a game, it's informative, it's what we all needed but didn't know it yet.<br /><br />Culled from interview questions lobbed at the artist Chuck Close by P.S. 8's 5th grade students, this is a title that is part Q&A, part explanation of artistic techniques, and part flip book. From his earliest days Chuck had the makings of an artist. Which is to say, he was a bedridden kid whose poor health enabled him to draw. His parents encouraged Chuck's desire and though he was not a particularly good student in other areas, in art he thrived. Eventually he was able to cultivate a style entirely of his own, until \\"The Event\\" when he was paralyzed. Yet even after that trauma he was able to continue his art. The children's questions go through Close's life and even allow him to explain his artistic techniques. Backmatter includes a Timeline, Resources, a Glossary, a List of Illustrations and an Index. Curiously the only other children's book about Chuck Close ([[ASIN:0789426587 Chuck Close Up Close]] by Jan Greenberg) is not one of the eight books listed in the Resources section at the back of the book.<br /><br />We talk all the time about role models and how to find them. Chuck Close is probably as close as you can get to a perfect role model in terms of difficulties he has faced. First and foremost there was the nephritis that rendered him bedridden at the age of 11 and gave him plenty of drawing time (he and Andy Warhol have this much in common). Then there was his prosopagnosia or \\"face blindness\\" which kept him from recognizing other people. Add onto that the fact that he got terrible grades (graduating high school without being able to add, subtract or multiply) and then later suffered a collapsed artery in his spine which paralyzed him from the waist down and you basically have a fellow who knows adversity better than most. With all that in mind, the book certainly makes it clear that his success wasn't the result of being some kind of an artistic genius. Over and over again Chuck reiterates that \\"Inspiration is for amateurs. Artists just show up and get to work. Every idea occurs while you are working\\" and later \\"Ease is the enemy of the artist. Go ahead and get yourself into trouble.\\"<br /><br />The book's job was to organize the questions and answers in such a way as to create a kind of narrative. The kids questions tend to be things like \\"Do you work from live models or photographs?\\" and \\"Do others help you make your art?\\" Fortunately someone took the time to find the questions that seem the most biographical and put them at the start. Then she played with them, making \\"How did you become such a great artist?\\" first as a kind of jumping off point for the book and \\"Do you have any advice for young artists?\\" last. The selection of the art and photographs must have taken some timeas well (luckily Chuck was the kind of kid who liked to have interesting pictures taken with monkeys or top hats), and the end product is ultimately vibrant. I was relieved to see that Chuck's most famous self-portrait, the one taken in 1968 of him smoking a cigarette, was included in the book. In an era where cigarettes are airbrushed out of 1940s dust jacket photos (see: Goodnight Moon) it comes as an odd relief to see the past unwhitewashed. And don't worry, oh ye concerned parents. Chuck takes the time to inform the kids that smoking isn't the way to go and that he did it \\"before people knew how bad smoking is for the body\\".<br /><br />You can see why Close is such a perfect artistic subject for children. He only does faces, not nudes or cow corpses cut in half or profanity laden photography. Just faces. Sometimes his subjects don't wear shirts, but since you're only getting their faces anyway it's hardly do or die. School assignments of Mr. Close are therefore inevitable. With that in mind there seems to have been a conscious effort to make this book as enjoyable as possible. A Q&A book with photographs spotted throughout the text could have been easy enough as it was. Dry but easy. I'd love to know whose idea it was to make the center into a flip book of fourteen of Close's portraits. They line-up beautifully against one another. Even if you look at a face that was painted in the early 70s and compare it to one taken in the last few years, because Close is such a master they still line-up. Kids will enjoy the simple rudimentary aspects of the biography but they'll pore over the images in the flip section. For once you can hand them a nonfiction title that's loads of fun.<br /><br />One of the book's strengths is that Close is the perfect subject for kids because he is in a unique position that allows him to teach them about different painting techniques. In the course of the book seventeen different processes are explained to kids. Unfortunately for us, in the interests of time or space Chuck will usually give a rough overview of a process but not explain it in any depth. For example a mention of Close's tapestries simply says that they're woven in Belgium and that Close takes \\"the photographs they are made from\\" and he oversees each step of the process. I'm not quite sure what that means and I'm not sure a kid would either. Fortunately a Glossary at the back does provide a little insight as to what an acid bath or a silkscreen might be. Therefore the book acts as a kind of starting point for kids interested in these techniques. For more information they'll have to seek out other books on their own.<br /><br />Though he doesn't belabor the point, it is clear after reading this book that much of Close's life can be attributed to the plethora of art classes he had access to as a kid. Even though he grew up in what he describes as a poor town, his school still had the time and resources to hand their students art materials. In an age when artistic programs are increasingly cut in the name of testing it's important to see how future artists may only appear where schools foster these programs. Certainly Mr. Close's life is evidence of this. His autobiography is bound to interest budding artists and, thanks to its eclectic formatting, even those kids without a drop of artistic interest in their blood. Though it is only 56 pages this is one title that delivers a wallop. A great way to present an artist.

US	33323458	RC0KYR31DDPIH	0890515840	696139604	Deadly Disclosures (Dinah Harris Mystery)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Decent Read, No Literary Masterpiece	I purchaed all three books in this series after hearing rave reviews, and was very excited to get them.  I enjoy crime fiction and science, so the combination of the two intrigued me- as did the fact that the books espouse views with which I agree. However, I was vastly disappointed with Deadly Disclosures (the second book in the series, The Shadowed Mind, was better in my opinion) because of the hype.  I'm left in a quandry, because it WAS very difficult to put the book down, yet it just wasn't the quality I was expecting. Conversely, the plot line was quite compelling and for an easy, quick read- it was enjoyable. The book has definite pros and definite cons. Becuase most of the reviews are very positive, I've chosen to list the cons first, followed by pros.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. The biggest Con, and by far the most distracting, is the clear reliance Ms. Cave has on other works. Anyone familiar with John Grisham would probably quickly recognize the parallels between Deadly Disclosures and The Appeal. It's as if Ms. Cave liked the political corruption/politician supported by corrupt group/conspiracy themes in The Appeal, then tweaked them to fit Deadly Disclosures.  Secondly, Ms. Cave appears to draw from NCIS and change the NCIS characters ever so slightly. For instance, instead of a young, spunky, jokey goth female lab worker, there is a young, punk/gothy, spunky, jokey male lab worker.  Instead of a British, highly intelligent, trivia-spewing,  bowtie-wearing older doctor who talks to the bodies on whom he performs autopsies, there is a highly intelligent,  trivia-spewing, bowtie-wearing older doctor who nicknames  the bodies on whom he performs autopies.  Dinah Harris and her partner share a take-off of the witty banter shared between NCIS' Ziva and Tony. Any NCIS fan would likely immediately think \\"female Abby!\\" \\"Ducky!\\" \\"Ziva!\\" \\"Tony\\" when reading about these characters. The similarities between The Appeal and Deadly Disclosures fade somewhat as the DeadlyDisclosures unfolds. The character simiilarities with NCIS, however, remained jarring. It was as if Ms. Cave developed a plot line, then couldn't invent characters so decided to people it with character types she had seen proven successes elsewhere. The result was a flat, unreal, and even spoof-like feeling.  Perhaps a non-fan of NCIS would find the characters ring true- I certainly didn't.<br /><br />2. The writing was just, simply, not  advanced enough for the type of novel. It sounded like young-adult fiction writing, yet was attempting to cover fairly lengthy scientific arguments and moral themes which are, while not inappropriate for younger readers, likely boring and unrelatable to most. Not only did the novel sound as if it was written FOR a 15-year-old, it also sounded as if it was written BY one.<br /><br />3. Related to #2, the emotions and anguish of the main character seemed contrived- like someone was trying to imagine how a person going through heartache would react, rather than actually writing about true, raw heartache.<br /><br />4. There is a grand tradition of discussing scientific or philosophic principles through drama, prose, and poetry stemming from the Greeks and traveling right up through Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, the works of Milton, Dante's Inferno, and the layered allegories of George MacDonald and C.S. Lewis.  However- in order for such a scheme to ring true, it requires thought and precise focus--neither of which were applied here, it seems. Again, instead of creating characters which espouse their own views, Ms. Cave puts the words of well-known Creationist apologists in her characters- practically VERBATIM from the apologists talks and books. The characters ALL sound the same when they delve into the scientific discussions. They do not have their own voices (instead, they all speak with the voice of the apologists). As such, the book turns into an apologetics textbook. And, while I love science- there were just far, far, FAR to may pages-long apologist debates or discusions in throughout. If, for example, Ms. Cave had managed to inject some of these principles and debates into the crime investigation itself, rather than fairly surpurflous discussions, it would have been less draining to read.<br /><br />5. The end is a bit hokey. Unfortunately, though The Shadowed Mind was better throughout, the ending was similarly hokey.<br /><br />6. As other reviewers have mentioned, the editing was atrocious.  One of the most obvious and glaring problems was the fact that everyone was \\"ringing\\" instead of \\"calling\\" each other. The second most glaring were obvious typos- both mis-spellings and wrong words. Someone should have Americanized the verbage (considering the book is very heavily focused on American politics and based entirely in America) and  performed a SPELL CHECK before publication, at the least.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. The plot line is interesting and intriguing. Though it seems very close to The Appeal at first, it soon veers into an entirely different direction.<br /><br />2. Even with the problems outlined above, the book was pretty hard to put down.<br /><br />3. The book is very clean- PG or lower. Very refreshing in the crime fiction realm.<br /><br />4. Ms. Cave worked out (most of) the kinks in Deadly Disclosure. The writing matures greatly in The Shadowed Mind and the Eugenics discussions are better (and more believably) interwoven with the story. The second book is better by far- and it is worthwhile to read Deadly Disclosures to set the stage for The Shadowed Mind.<br /><br />5. The book comes from a unique and different viewpoint- one which many would oppose, but which nonetheless is at least worth exploring.<br /><br />My overall feeling is, it's just a shame Ms. Cave didn't have a better editor and a couple more re-writes before Deadly Disclosure was published.  My initial impression after reading Deadly Disclosures is that the writer was not particularly great. The Shadowed Mind shows much better, more developed writing skill- which probably would have been apparent in Deadly Disclosure had it been worked over a little more.	2012-05-03

Back in 1964, I was introduced to 'Johnnie' Johnson, the legendary RAF fighter ace, through reading his evocative WING LEADER autobiography. What a marvelous piece of writing that was; who would have thought a fighter ace could spin such memorable prose?!? Johnson's life and combat career are wonderfully chronicled in Dilip Sarkar's SPITFIRE ACE OF ACES, a 2011 Amberley Publishing release.<br /><br />With 38 1/2 kills, Johnson is the RAF's official top ace. All his kills were enemy fighters; all were scored while flying Spits. Yet, even more importantly, Johnson was one of the best fighter leaders the RAF produced during the war. These accomplishments resulted from Johnson being an avid hunter pre-war and an aggressive, enthusiastic sportsman who possessed the ability to motivate and lead men into combat. Initially flying with one of the most charismatic wing leaders - Douglas Bader - Johnson surpassed Bader, not only in terms of kills, but also in truly effective leadership that made every man in Johnson's unit feel important and part of a team.<br /><br />Sarkar does a fine job of relating Johnson's wartime career and the greatness inherent in the man. He interweaves material from interviews done with JEJ and his fellow RAF compatriots, Johnson's WING LEADER book, wartime news articles and official documents to create a multi-dimensional portrait. The text is illustarted with over 100 photographs, many of them rare.<br /><br />SPITFIRE ACE OF ACES is, very likely, THE definitive account of the life and times of this RAF legend. It deserves five stars. I had to give it four - actually 4 1/2 - because Sarkar didn't include an index.<br /><br />In any case, SPITFIRE ACE OF ACES is a wonderfully-researched, nicely-illustrated and appealing book that will appeal to all air combat enthusiasts. Highly recommended.	2012-05-03

I loved these books and have read them over and over.  When I just picked up Deadlocked, I was like, what the heck!!!  This isn't nearly long enough!<br /><br />I felt like the book was filled with fluff and the plot line was thin.  So much time was spent on Sookie doing chores.  Perhaps the author wanted us to see her doing every day things?<br /><br />Like other reviewers said, if you like Eric, you won't like this book.  I don't understand what happened to his character so fast.  The majority of the series was built of the Sookie/Eric tension and then they got to a great relationship.  I often found Sookie annoying, but Eric's character kept yanking me back with his humor and whit.  This book makes him look terrible.  I feel let down in that so many years were invested in getting to see him become a better person and love Sookie, just to have them appearing to go their separate ways.<br /><br />There was too much Bill in this book.  We went books and books without Bill, and now he was in this book so much.<br /><br />I felt from the very beginning Sookie would end up with Sam.  I really didn't want this to happen.  Couldn't the girl just have a close guy friend?  I was hoping she'd use the cluviel dor to make Eric human.  Perhaps he wouldn't have wanted it, but if she was being such a baby about it, why didn't she at least talk to him about it?<br /><br />Anyway, I felt the author was really trying to wrap things up in this book, getting ready for the last one next year.  I thought things were too rushed and I don't like where things are going.  The Fae left too quickly.. Anyways, this is my opinion, I hope the next book is longer (without the fluff) and leaves us satisfied.. but I'm thinking I'm going to be disappointed with that one as well.	2012-05-03

Make It Fun.: The Key to Success in Life, Death, and Almost Everything in Between	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Left me wanting more	Reading this book, I hoped to find more about success in life in general... but mostly what I found was about finding fulfillment in the daily grind. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing at all against making the most of fulfilling our responsibilities. We all need to do it. And really enjoying one's job, etc., is certainly a skill vital to having a great life. But when it comes to living -- just living -- there's more to life than \\"spicing up meetings.\\"<br /><br />And that's where this book left me feeling a bit left down. I think what it comes down to is this: Culberson makes a lot of assumptions that I and many others simply don't agree with. What he takes as the basic framework of life -- meetings, taxes, even having a job at all -- many others have managed successfully to do without. Take, for example, the inspiring story of the man who walked across America, [[ASIN:096387845X I Walked to the Moon and Almost Everybody Waved: The Curiously Inspiring Adventures of a Free Spirit Who Changed Lives]] by Ed Carlson.<br /><br />So if you are simply looking for a nice read on how to make the most of the rat race, I recommend Do It Well Make It Fun. But if you are looking for something more substantial that really digs in and questions common assumptions, I recommend looking somewhere else.	2012-05-03

Again, his particular voice keeps you pinned to the page, the language always beautiful as the characters navigate lives both lucky and miserable. The narrative is full--impressively epic and superbly paced, given the sweeping terrain. But perhaps the best thing about PB is that he is authentic, incapable of false notes/forced epiphanies/melodramas. Tender moments are hard won.	2012-05-03

I'm with the review by Eileen Duncan on this one.  While the author did occasionally show some flair for writing witty sentences and funny descriptive phrases, I found all of the characters unbelievable and unsympathetic, and their motivations completely unconvincing.  The real teller of how self-consciously congratulatory this book is appears at the back, where the edition I read actually had readers' group's discussion questions included! REALLY?  For something as shallow and frivolous as this debut novel, soaked in blood and gruesomeness?  And of course, all this horrible stuff happens to her while her husband is away and unreachable (hence the placing of the action in the pre-cell phone days!), and no one thinks to have the heroine go stay with someone to keep her safe? Or to accompany her when she places herself in ridiculously dangerous situations for no reason?  Self-indulgent, indeed.	2012-05-03

He was the author of many influential books, such as [[ASIN:1565630416 The History of the Synoptic Tradition]], [[ASIN:0684143909 Jesus and the Word]], etc. Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) was a German psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher, who wrote many important books such as [[ASIN:B000S6THQE Reasons and Existenz]][[ASIN:0812210107 Philosophy of Existence]], [[ASIN:0300097352 Way to Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy]], [[ASIN:B0007EW69C Man in the modern age]], [[ASIN:0226394859 Future of Mankind]], etc.<br /><br />The translator notes, \\"The essay 'Myth and Religion' by Dr. Jaspers ... was later published (in 1953)... Bultmann's reply first appeared (in 1954)... Dr. Jaspers' rejoinder was first published in an open letter...\\"<br /><br />Jaspers argues, \\"It we forget that myth is also a code language, a cipher, it loses all reference to transcendence, it becomes mere tangible presence.\\" (Pg. 14) He suggests that Bultmann \\"alternates between empirical, philological exegesis and a theological appropriation of religion. The two opposing goals, which are the historical investigation of religion and the primary comprehension of faith, do not add up to a convincing statement, but rather collapse for lack of tension and clarity.\\" (Pg. 28)<br /><br />Bultmann replied, \\"(Jaspers) is as convinced as I am that a corpse cannot come back to life or rise from the grave, that there are no demons and no magic causality. But how am I, in my capacity as pastor, to explain, in my sermons and classes, texts dealing with the Resurrection of Jesus in the flesh, with demons, or with magic causality? And how am I, in my capacity as theological scholar, to guide the pastor in his task by my interpretation?... When (Jaspers) says that the redemptive history... must 'be tested existentially and judged on the basis of ... the truth that arises from it in the reality of life,' I can only reply to such a vague statement by the question, 'Well, how is this done?'\\" (Pg. 60-61)<br /><br />Jaspers then asserts in his own reply, \\"you do not go far enough... I assay the differences between us in terms of the opposition between liberalism and orthodoxy, and I conclude that your position can be defined as orthodox. The actual meaning of my lecture, however, was to asert the rights of philosophy.\\" (Pg. 72) He concludes, \\"The greatness of Protestantism... achieves reality only in exceptional individuals... who translate into action the great moral earnestness... inherent in this faith... I see hope in the liberal faith... which as such is capable of transforming the Biblical faith in all its manifestations.\\" (Pg. 114-115)<br /><br />Although one suspects that the two protagonists are often missing the other's point, this still a fascinating interplay between these two thinkers.a vague statement by the question, 'Well, how is this done?'\\" (Pg. 60-61)    Jaspers then asserts in his own reply, \\"you do not go far enough...

The Big Town is a tremendously satisfying conclusion to Monte Schulz's epic trilogy of 1920's America. Harry Hennesey is our everyman, struggling to survive in a big hard town. But Harry is complex and unique, for he struggles with Chicago and also with himself. Harry's passion for women threatens not only his young family but also his work and his life. What makes Harry unique is his inner awareness of his weakness. He's a good man at center, he knows what he should be doing, he knows how far from that he is, and that pain informs every choice he makes.<br /><br />Harry's problems are brought to crisis when he meets a young girl, a girl who will ignite both his romantic interest and his protective instincts. Wondering which side of Harry will win the day creates the driving tension, set against the backdrop of a Chicago ruled both by the Mafia and by the superrich. Harry and Pearl are caught up in the danger and chaos of both. And what none of these characters can know is that Black Friday is dead ahead. We can only wonder if Harry will choose his new love, Pearl, or his distant and waiting family. What will win, the inner self he fears, or the man he yearns to be?<br /><br />What Schulz has achieved with this trilogy is an exploration of the dual nature of the human soul. Are we animal or angel? In This Side of Jordan we met those who would follow their animal side. They want and they get-- at any cost. In The Last Rose of Summer we met those who serve duty and love-- who wait. And here we have the blending of both, not only in one book, but in two characters. Harry, who is a man who seems to serve his family, his business, his responsibilities, and is torn by his desires, and Pearl, who is apparently a good-time girl but is secretly carrying a tremendous burden of responsibility to the last of her family. These two damaged people meet and find their way toward becoming whole.<br /><br />This novel speaks to what we all seek:  an answer to who we are. Are we the sum of all we do, good or bad? Can we pick and choose? Finally, can we become the people we hope to be? I think, with this book, we have reason for optimism. This isn't a sugar-coated lesson here. This is a book that shows you Chicago as it was, and human beings as they are. The writing and voice are as good as they get. A beautifully-crafted, epic and important book. I hope to see this trilogy in a single volume soon.um of all we do, good or bad? Can we pick and choose? Finally, can we become the people we hope to be?

US	52978967	R1363VA3TPNLVB	0670022969	432940103	American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America	Books	5	370	388	N	Y	Like scales falling from my eyes	Colin Woodard has written the story of North America that should be taught in school in place of the simplified, sanitized, nearly fictional versions created, like all national histories, for the purpose of welding disparate peoples into a single nation by convincing them they all share a common history.  I just got it back from loaning to a friend and re-read it.  Like other reviewers here I had read Joel Garreau's \\"Nine Nations\\" in the 1980s and more recently Kevin Phillips' \\"The Cousins Wars\\" and Dante Chinni's \\"Patchwork Nation\\".  They were full of interesting information, but Nine Nations and Patchwork Nation didn't address the origins or persistence of the notable regional differences among North Americans.  I think Woodard's main thesis is that these regional cultures left their marks so deeply that we are no longer consciously aware of them, and should be.  My experience living and working in several of these \\"nations\\" indicates that the regional differences do persist, though national media and advertising have masked them.<br /><br />Reading \\"American Nations\\" I felt the pieces falling into place.  I am undecided on the question of just how valid the thesis of eleven rival nations is as political science, but it makes for a fine explication of our history.  And as cultural anthropology it provides the same level of explanatory power for understanding our cultural differences that the theory of evolution provided for understanding biology, or that the theory of plate tectonics did for understanding planetary-scale geologic processes.  Just as those two sciences could not advance beyond the observational phase without a theoretical framework, this third dimension of historical immigration patterns transforms a two-dimensional hodgepodge of cultural observations into a meaningful three-dimensional portrait far more illuminating than the usual North-South analysis.<br /><br />The map on the \\"American Nations\\" cover showed me that I grew up roughly where the Deep South, Appalachia, and El Norte meet in eastern Texas.  We said we were \\"Scotch-Irish\\" but seemed to have no knowledge of or interest in how we came to be there, nor did I ever know anyone who was aware that there were early Spanish missions in the pine woods of East Texas or that there had been a large Cherokee village not four miles from my home.  Later I learned that my own family had entered the U.S. in South Carolina from Barbados in the 1680s; little is known about them except that they were poor whites, so now we know there is a good chance they were indentured servants to Barbadian slave lords.  How many Americans know the Deep South was founded at Charleston by migrants from Barbados?  I never did. I had always lumped Tidewater, Appalachia, and the Deep South as \\"the South\\", but distinguishing them by origin explains a lot.<br /><br />Now I have some insight into features of my county that have puzzled me for decades: why the tiny community where I attended school in the 1950s and 60s was clustered around its original plantation house, Cumberland Presbyterian church, and cotton fields (it was founded by a slave-holding family from Savannah, Georgia in the 1840s or 50s); why my neighbors had such casual contempt for blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Indians, Catholics, Chinese, and all other foreigners; why Ku Klux Klan actions were still fresh in older folks' memories; why blacks lived either in their own parts of town literally across the tracks or entirely separately in their own towns or isolated communities tucked away in the woods; why my parents were so puzzled that \\"our Negroes\\" seemed dissatisfied with our hand-me-down clothes and an occasional pig (I recall puzzled discussions of \\"What do they want?\\" implying lack of gratitude); why some neighbors said \\"Bide a wee\\" for \\"stay a while\\" or occasionally exclaimed \\"Gott in himmel!\\" but otherwise spoke in Texas drawl; why hillfolk in remote cabins in the woods practiced subsistence hunting using antique Springfield and Henry rifles, had a near-religious devotion to one-shot kills and complete disregard for hunting season and licenses, and distilled their own liquor (Appalachians for sure!); why there was a deeply ingrained presumption that gentlemen rode horses and peasants walked, so any poor farmer that came into oil money bought horses immediately (Deep South cavaliers influence); why there was hardly any familiarity with or emphasis on attending college, and disdain for the (rare) \\"know it all college boy\\" (Appalachian ignorance and apathy influenced by Deep South resistance to education for the masses); why employers referred to employees as \\"hands\\"; why our relatives in far southwest Texas seemed to us to live in a different country (they did - El Norte), while relatives in Tennessee and business associates in Mississippi seemed to come from an earlier and more violent time; why Cajuns in south Louisiana and southeast Texas seemed like such an anomaly in the Deep South in their Catholicism and complete disregard of racial boundaries (New France egalitarianism); maybe even why some blacks in East Texas practiced a strange mixture of Southern Baptist services and voodoo lore - one local black church was even named the Voodoo Baptist Church, and the pastor roamed the area on foot wearing an animal skin cape and carrying a long shepherd's staff (West Africa via the West Indies). Does any of this sound like growing up in Michigan?  Have you lived in a state with a state religion?  Texas has one, best characterized as southernbaptistfootball. Recognition that the region is essentially Appalachia with a strong Deep Southern influence and only faint traces of Spanish and Indian influence remaining provides the key to unlock all those scattered observations made as an ignorant but curious youth.<br /><br />Knowing the origins of Yankeedom, the Midlands, Tidewater, and the cavalier South even sheds light on why North Dakotans and Minnesotans, coastal Northern Californians, Oregonians, Washingtonians, and my in-laws in Evanston, Illinois are so similar to New England Yankees, while my prospective in-laws in northern Virginia were deeply interested in our \\"bloodlines\\".<br /><br />Appalachia and the Deep South were of particular interest to me, but the story of the founding and migrations of El Norte, New England, New Netherland, New France, the Midlands, Tidewater, the Far West, the Left Coast, and more recently the founding of the Canadian First Nation are completely fascinating and illuminating, and leave me embarrassed at how much is new to me.  (Woodard could've made it an even dozen by including New Sweden, a Swedish colony along the Delaware River in parts of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania from 1638 to 1655!  I guess it didn't leave enough of a cultural mark.)<br /><br />Lastly, I did not think Woodard unfairly favored the Yankees; his description showed the harsh, violent, and meddlesome parts of their Puritan cultural heritage along with the elements we still cherish (for much more detail see Fischer's \\"Albion's Seed\\").  The key difference is that Yankees changed with the times.  Nor did I take the epilogue as an unwelcome interjection of personal opinion.  I read it as unflinching commentary that grappled with unpleasant realities and made some educated extrapolations regarding possible futures for the U.S. and North America.  Woodard is not the first to speculate along these lines of fracture, as he notes.  And I have made the same comments on \\"the Baptist equivalent of sharia law\\" since the conservative coup of the Southern Baptist Convention in the mid-1990s.  The Deep South has been a reluctant participant in the U.S. federation and has routinely made threats to withdraw since the Articles of Confederation days; in the 2010 mid-term election we again heard southern politicians talk of secession.  That would be either puzzling or shocking without this deep background.  Can a nation-state cobbled together from Dutch, Spanish, French, and multiple waves of incompatible English colonists, along with unwilling Indians and Africans, really hold together for another 200 years?  Maybe a mutual divorce based on irreconcilable differences would eventually result in more compatible second marriages for all or even decisions that they prefer to go it alone.<br /><br />And really lastly - I've enjoyed and learned nearly as much from the reviewers and commenters here as from the book.egonians, Washingtonians, and my in-laws in Evanston, Illinois are so similar to New England Yankees, while my prospective in-laws in northern Virginia were deeply interested in our \\"bloodlines\\".<br /><br />Appalachia and the Deep South were of particular interest to me, but the story of the founding and migrations of El Norte, New England, New Netherland, New France, the Midlands, Tidewater, the Far West, the Left Coast, and more recently the founding of the Canadian First Nation are completely fascinating and illuminating, and leave me embarrassed at how much is new to me.

The idea of spending a short time on preparation, putting it all into one pot, leaving it on a low heat or delayed setting and coming back home in the evening to a ready warm dish is very enticing.<br />This book, part of a very broad series, provides 101 different tried and tested recipes that will please a wide range of tastes.  There is a lot more to slow cooking than a variation on a stew, that is to be sure and through this book you cannot fail but find a few more favoured recipes<br />Many people, this reviewer included, have thought that slow cooking was mostly for the evening meal, but there are even many recipes for breakfast so you have no excuse for not tucking into something warm and wholesome before you make a rush to school or work.<br />Once you have run through the range of enticing breakfasts, you can look at various meat dishes, seafood, vegetables and vegetarian dishes. Sweets, jams and chutneys can even be prepared in a slow cooker to boot.<br />In many ways you might find that your slow cooker gets used rather a lot as you could first set your cooker to make your breakfast and, if there is time, then prepare the evening meal so it can slow cook during the day. Or, if you are super efficient, pre-prepare as much as you can for both dishes the night before and then do the small bits you have to at the last minute.<br />As in common with each BBC GoodFood book, layout and presentation is simple and to the point. The recipe, introduction, ingredients and methodology appear on one side and on the facing page is a full colour picture of the dish. Internal signposting is excellent and a great index aids the book if you really wish to dive in at a particular tangent or ingredient.<br />Every book in this series has so far been a little gem and this one is no exception.  Now the only problem might be what slow cooker to buy so that one may try out properly what one might have been missing!rly what one might have been missing!	2012-05-03

While my heart goes out to Araby for what she goes through, this makes is a little harder to connect with her. I had the same problem with most of the other characters. We only skimmed the surface when I felt like there was so much more beneath their masks.<br /><br />The romance was twisted yet incredibly sweet -- just like the two boys. There are secrets, sacrifices, and huge surprises you won't expect. Bethany Griffin knows how to write suspense! And even though I wish there was more of a punch to that build-up, it still left me craving to know how anything could possibly work out in this bleak world.<br /><br />Deliciously dark and hauntingly beautiful, Masque of the Red Death sits up there with Kelly Creagh's Nevermore on my list of coolest Poe-inspired books! It wasn't as mind-blowing as I'd hoped, but it still stuck with me and I can't wait to read the next. :)<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: Edgar Allan Poe fans, get ready to empty your wallets! Don't let the rating fool you -- this book is definitely worth the read! Am I the only one hoping this will be turned into a movie? x)	2012-05-02

There's a flow, a grace to the way these writers construct their sentences that makes reading a joy.<br /><br />Ben Wretlind is one of those writers, although his story is anything but joyful. Castles: A Fictional Memoir of a Girl with Scissors, fits into the \\"magic realism\\" category, although I did not know that when I started reading the book.<br /><br />The story begins with Maggie at age six, living in a trailer on the edge of the desert, somewhere in the US, in fear of dust storms and her drunken, abusive mother. The only light in her life comes from her Grandma, who protects her from her mother's worst and advises the young girl to listen to the voices in the wind. When Grandma dies, Maggie is literally on her own.<br /><br />Maggie learns quickly to stay out of her mother's way, not to engage with her mother's boyfriends and how to \\"clean up her messes.\\" That's the central theme of the novel.<br /><br />This novel is one of those where you can take the possibly magical elements and view them as only symbolism, and as a childish or psychologically damaged mind's interpretation of strange events. For example, there's the old school bus on the edge of the desert, just outside the trailer park. It's irresistible forbidden adventure to children, whose parents tell them not to go inside for their own good. Of course, the kids can't resist it. It represents forbidden adventure, the dangerous wild beyond the fences, the untameable forces of nature that erode anything made by humans.<br /><br />And it's also a portal to the unknown and to the underworld. You can take it literally or as just the way that Maggie sees it. Beyond the bus is the desert. It periodically sends dust storms that smash through windows and clean up messes.<br /><br />As I said, this is not a joyful book. Maggie is abused by her mother and others, she's raped by her mother's boyfriend, her boyfriend disappears,presumably murdered, her dog is butchered and she takes a series of abusive boyfriends, herself.<br /><br />On the surface, it's a story of a girl in a very hard life, learning how to cope with pain and terror -- how to \\"clean up her mess.\\" And she also learns how to integrate the unknown terrors of the world beyond the abandoned . Maggie learns also to listen to the wind, finally. And within the wind and the dust storms, she discovers ... well, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that within the storms, she finds the agents of just retribution and the strength to clean up her mess and take control of her own life.<br /><br />And yet, you can also read this as the warped interpretation of a woman forced through years of abuse to do ... again, I don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this book. It reminds me of Palahniuk in his darker moments. Wretlind is not afraid to put his readers and his characters through horrible situations, and to describe them clearly, without pretense and without squeamishness. But if you're squeamish, you might have trouble in some parts.<br /><br />Wretlind writes with that fluid, clear, spare style that the big publishing houses all say they demand (and then publish crap that does not adhere to it). So, even though the situation was horrible, Wretlind tells the story very, very well.<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />Highly recommended	2012-05-02
US	33011006	R3367UPK2VDQRL	0983713006	904969324	The Commission: Qi Saga Book One	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of My Favorite Sci-Fi Books!	As one of the best science fiction novels today, The Commission Qi Saga (book 1) delivers a well-thought-of storyline and concept. Its background is interestingly set billions of light years into the future so one can imagine how advanced the technology is, as well as the new attitude of humanity.<br /><br />No matter how advanced the new world order is, however, the problems faced by the people of the new times are still the same things that affect today's mankind. The dark energy that surrounds the Qi universe threatens to wreck havoc to the system, and this results in massive poverty and war just like in the real world.<br /><br />The novel mainly revolves around a set of ancient equations, which somehow predicts the possible destination of mankind and their method of existence. While the so-called \\"Commission\\" aims to destroy the peace and order of the new dimension, the \\"Brotherhood\\" has been tasked to fight and protect the rights of the people. And through all of these, the team of Pandora merely hopes to profit from the war and dilemma that engulfs the system.<br /><br />As a reader, I was affected that the fate of the Qi universe seems uncertain. The author was able to give a vivid description of how things are going on in this universe, and the way its impending destruction was described can really be quite disturbing and alarming. It's almost as if my own personal safety is also on the line as with the people of those times.<br /><br />Fortunately, there's hope in all these chaos, as there exists a black mysterious pearl that can turn the dark fate of the universe into something more encouraging and worth looking forward to. And personally, in spite of all the negative forces that prevail in this future world, I still want it saved and reconstructed to fit the existence of human life.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a space adventure saga as it deals with modern technology and existence of futuristic methods. There are suspense, thriller and horror aspectstoo, as the battle of good versus evil happens in this universe too. In spite of the twists and mysteries, however, there are also romantic moments to keep the heart in focus amidst all the wars and confusion.<br /><br />The situation in the Qi universe can be compared to the present situation of mankind and the problems that we are facing today. As such, it raises the question of man's duty and purpose of existence. Moreover, it makes us look into the future with anticipation and caution as our actions will definitely have an impact to future generations.<br /><br />The characters in the book are all realistic, and readers will find it easy to relate and identify with them. Ara, who possesses the black pearl, is the heroine; and she serves as a great inspiration. As the pearl is capable of saving or destroying the universe, it gives readers the opportunity to dwell on the idea on whether it is indeed worth saving or not.<br /><br />El, the other main character of the story, has somewhat lost his faith in the futuristic universe; and we can also relate to his sentiments as we are also seeing the same disheartening problems in our present world.<br /><br />This book is truly a great sci-fi novel, and it is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Just when you think you got it all figured out, the characters behave differently to add more twists and turns to the story. And for that, I commend the author, S. Dawn Nelson. I am a fan of science fiction, and this is one of my favorite books to date.	2012-05-02

I also read Cleave's \\"Little Bee\\", as engaging a book as you want to pick up. However, this is different, both in style and content. Told through the voice of a lower class woman in London who is writing a letter to Osama Bin Laden after her husband and son were killed (along with hundreds of others) in an al-Qaeda suicide bomb attack at a soccer match. At the very moment of the explosion, the woman is not only having sex on her living room sofa with a local reporter she'd only recently met, but was also watching the match on TV and saw the explosion happen.<br /><br />Her successes and failures at dealing with that tragedy are visceral and real. You are inside her head always, and can easily sympathize with her reactions to situations. Cleave's ability to speak as a woman is extraordinary and makes even the male reader understand her reactions. Of course, she not only has to deal with the death of her two family members, but also with severe living restrictions put in place by the British and London governments following the attack. Just as the specter of 9-11 in America changed how we live in many ways, terrorism in London has had a similar, but perhaps more drastic affect on life there.<br /><br />It's truly a remarkable book, and I strongly encourage you to get it today. You won't be disappointed.	2012-05-02

In doing so they are returning to their primary mission of selling models. Studio 4 is a great product, but this book won't help you navigate the features or the new interface, nor will it help you with most of the new figures or plugins. This is more of an ad for what the product can do, IF you know how to use it.  Hopefully they (or someone) will issue a comprehensive manual soon. Daz has invested a lot of time and money into its very versatile Genesis figure line which only works in Studio and has extensive features you will not learn about in this book. At this time your best reference to Studio is a group of tutorial films they've put on youtube. While these videos cover individual aspects of the program, not having a book that can be easily referenced for details is VERY frustrating. It means that you have stop what you are doing and find a video every time you want to use another feature. At least the videos go into more depth than this book does, but neither is likely to address exactly what you want to do. I'll post back if they put out a book that is more useful.

So most likely this will be more of a honest review than most so-called \\"book critics\\" (Hey reader, did you hear that? I'm making fun of book critics!). Anyways, the book is called \\"You Can't Have My Planet: But Take My Brother, Please!\\" by James Mihaley. Thirteen-year-old Giles stumbles upon a situation where Earth is up for sale and its current tenants, humans, are going to be evicted. Giles inadvertently gets the task to represent and defend his race in an intergalactic court of law. With the help of his siblings, friends and an alien lawyer, Giles sets out to prove that humans deserve to stay on Earth. But there are some that are determined to make Giles, and the human race fail...<br /><br />I've read some reviews, a lot of them good. Some not-so-good... really? Some \\"critics\\" read too much into the story (pun intended). The story was fun from start to finish. This may be a book aimed towards a younger crowd but as an adult, I found it just as entertaining. The characters are exciting, the cheesy humor is spot on and the concept is well done and inspirational. The whole time reading this, I pictured the \\"movie version\\" in my head - either live action or one of those Pixar-type animated films. I, Kevin, can't wait for a possible movie for this! (Hey reader, if you know the author, can you ask him if I, Kevin, could have a part as a voice of one of the characters if an animated feature is made? Thanks!). The only problem I had with this book was when I finished it, I didn't want it to end...<br /><br />If you are an avid reader who doesn't wear \\"serious pants\\" and just want a fun and friendly book to read for a change, I highly recommend this book. Happy reading.	2012-05-02

Being a mother today takes the strength and stamina of a superhero.  The rewards are limitless, but so are the demands.  Without a foolproof way to recharge, productivity and patience start to wane.  You sacrifice one thing to accomplish another.  Or you struggle simply to get through the day.  Eventually your health and well being take a hit.<br /><br />As a mom, we give and give some more. We eat cold food, or nothing at all... or even worse, left over scraps off our children's plates. Our energy is depleted and most moms are searching for more energy.  I know I was, am, and will always continue to search for ways to keep up with my three active boys.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I finished reading a book called Mom Energy by Ashley Koff and Kathy Kaehler.  This book helps tired moms find their energy, and regain their focus back on them.<br /><br />Mom - n. The woman for whom energy demands consistently exceed her reserves<br /><br />The book Mom Energy speaks to all moms who are tired and are craving and seeking more energy.  The authors (one of them is a registered dietician) give tips and tricks on how to get your groove back.<br /><br />They divide the book into different talking points and sections: reorganize, recharge and rehabilitate.<br /><br />As a mom we must reorganize our priorities, first by putting our needs first.  We must recharge our own batteries to be able to keep up with our children and never ending to do list.  Lastly, we must rehabilitate and re-learn how to live a healthy and active (mom energy) life.<br /><br />MOM ENERGY Talking Points<br /><br />1. Mom Energy: There isn't a mom out there who isn't seeking better energy but what moms are often presented with are, at best, energy band-aids, at worst, energy zappers. We offer energy sustainers so that all moms can upgrade their energy<br /><br />2. The Core of the Mom Energy problem: It starts at the core -- digestive wellness! Over 25 million women have been diagnosed with irritable bowelsyndrome and millions more have digestive complaints. Our digestive system is where our energy begins and ends so digestive wellness is a key to Mom Energy.<br /><br />3. Nutrition and Balance: Most of the nutrition taught for years worked counter to how the body actually works -- and counter to good energy. Calorie counts, points, one food group over another, weighing foods ...moms have tried all of these and failed because they aren't physiologically delivering what the body wants and needs. We present eating occasions -- the concepts of nutrient balance and frequency -- and explain why this is the Mom Energy secret nutrition recipe for success.<br /><br />I really enjoyed and learned a lot from reading this book, and think that if you are searching for ways to get your groove back... find more mom energy you would benefit from reading this book!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book for free through netgalley for sole purpose to read, enjoy, and review.  No compensation was received.  All opinions are my own.	2012-05-02

It also has a list of a few good books to read for specific subjects like inking, story boarding and the usual all of which have been very useful. Prior to reading this I didn't really think about comics/graphic novels(same thing) as sequential art or even putting establishing shots. Some things mentioned are obvious others like the types of panels and what they are used for and word balloon counts not so much. If you are just starting out it has a lot of useful info and you might even feel like you know everything about the creation of a graphic novel. The truth is like any book on the subject it has some general info and a few things unique to the book it doesn't have everything about writing a graphic novel or making one you'd have to either take classes or read more books and a bunch of other self education and research. This is a great read if your new.

US	52977415	R3OW0AIVLEDIQ7	0262016729	624789283	The Clash of Generations: Saving Ourselves, Our Kids, and Our Economy (MIT Press)	Books	3	99	121	N	N	Fiscal analysis 1; Policy suggestions 3; Financial planning 5	This book covers three themes: 1) a fiscal analysis of the US; 2) a set of related policy recommendations; and 3) financial planning to survive the prospective challenging times.  In summary, the fiscal analysis is absurd. The policy recommendations are often quite all right.  And, the financial planning is outstanding.  Kotlikoff (the main author) does not have a good handle on macroeconomics (poor fiscal analysis).  But, the more he drills down to the individual level (financial planning) the more he excels.<br /><br />Kotlikoff's assessment of the US fiscal problems border on the absurd.  He advances that all familiar fiscal measurements like Budget Deficit/GDP or Debt/GDP are completely wrong.  And, that the only representative fiscal measure is his own construct: the US Fiscal Gap which he currently calculates at $211 trillion.  Kotlikoff artifically boosts his $211 trillion Fiscal Gap in several ways:<br /><br />... First, he relies on a worst case scenario: the CBO alternative scenario.  He wrongly dismisses the CBO baseline scenario as he thinks the latter freezes government spending as if there were no economic growth and no inflation.  This is incorrect.  The CBO baseline scenario is reasonable and relies on credible economic assumptions of long term GDP growth, inflation, and commensurate increase in Government spending.  However, it projects that current laws will be fully implemented.  The CBO alternative scenario uses the same economic assumptions, but it assumes that current laws will be tweaked (Bush tax cuts will not expire, AMT to be indexed).  Unsurprisingly, the CBO alternative scenario is unsustainable with a resulting skyrocketing US Debt/GDP ratio.<br /><br />... Second, he discounts future Budget Deficits by a surprisingly low discount rate of only 3%.  That is the simplest way to boost his overall Fiscal Gap.  Had he used a much more reasonable long term risk free rate of 5% to 6%, his Fiscal Gap would probably be less than half of the $211 trillion.<br /><br />... Third, his Fiscal Gap beyond 75 years (ending value) accounts for about two thirds of the total.  He probably calculates this ending value by taking the last estimated Budget Deficit in 75 years and dividing it by his discount rate minus an estimated growth of such Budget Deficits.  By using a growth rate nearly equal to his discount rate, he can generate any huge value he wants.<br /><br />As you can tell, Kotlikoff can use many levers to create a Fiscal Gap as incredible as he wants.  This does not mean this Fiscal Gap measure is representative, or even informative.  The opposite is closer to the truth.<br /><br />Kotlikoff sticking with his flawed Fiscal Gap calculations derives that Greece is in better shape than the US.  That's because their Fiscal Gap is only 12 times GDP vs the US' 14 times GDP.  Meanwhile, Greece before its most recent Euro Zone bail out had a Debt/GDP ratio close to 300%.  It just defaulted on nearly 70% of its Debt (70% write down on all debt held by private investors).  Greece is caught in a vicious recession with negative GDP contractions of 7% per year and unemployment of 21%.  Its 10 year interest rate on its debt is an unsustainably high 21%.  Meanwhile, the US Debt/GDP ratio is still a modest 72%.  Its economy is now growing at over 2% per year.  Unemployment rate is declining (currently 8.2%) and 10 year interest rates are less than 2%.  Last but not least, the US has full sovereign control of its fiscal and monetary policies.  Meanwhile, Greece does not, as it has become a ward of the Euro Zone.<br /><br />Besides his Fiscal Gap, Kotlikoff developed other dissonant macroeconomic constructs.  One of them is that foreign exchange levels have no impact on foreign trade flows.  Thus, China, in his view, does not manipulate its currency to boost its export to the US.  He states that if China would let its currency appreciate by 25% vs the Dollar, it would be associated with a 20% drop in its money supply, lowering its production costs by the same amount so the price of its exports (production costs times FX level) would actually not change!  There are several reasons why this principle is false.  FX levels are not so directly linked to money supply changes.  Also, the 20% drop in money supply, suggested by Kotlikoff, would cause a huge deflationary contraction leading to a potential Chinese Depression.  There is no way China could handle the repercution of a 20% contraction in its money supply.  Also, another way to demonstrate that Kotlikoff relationship between FX rates and money supply does not hold is how could his model handle a multi-currency world.  China has only one money supply that could not possibly manage ten different FX rates with different foreign currencies some being overvalued others undervalued relative to the Chinese currency.<br /><br />Another of his dissonant concepts is that the household sector is almost solely responsible for the US declining savings rate.  But, instead the Budget Deficit has had a huge impact on our nation's savings rate.  After all, his Fiscal Gap suggests that too.  That's a contradiction.<br /><br />Kotlikoff's description of upcoming run on Treasuries and related run on banks (depositors to \\"turn cash into closets full of canned soup\\") does not make sense.  He deducts those from his observations that in August 2011 when S&P downgraded US Debt from AAA to AA+, the stock market dropped by 20%.  However, he ommits to mention that at the same time Treasury yield dropped.  That's actually the opposite of a run on Treasuries.  That is a flight to quality towards Treasuries.<br /><br />When it comes to his recommendations, they are uneven some bad and some excellent ones.<br /><br />His plan to fix the international financial system by converting all banks to pass through entities like mutual funds is problematic.  It would eliminate credit formation.  Without that, an economy stalls.  Forget economic growth and rising living standard.<br /><br />His health care plan is the Paul Ryan plan for all.  The voucher system would control how much the Government spends on health care.  But, it would not control overall health care costs.  Thus, the public would be burdened with a rising portion of health care costs.  The CBO analysis of Paul Ryan's plan confirmed that.<br /><br />His tax plan is excellent.  He would replace the income tax by a consumption tax and inheritance tax with provisions to make them progressive.  It would raise more Government revenues more efficiently than the current tax code.<br /><br />His plan to privatize Social Security is very good.  The payroll tax would be 8% invested in a broadely diversified set of indices across numerous asset classes of stocks, bonds, and real estate.  The investment allocation would be very conservative with 60% allocated to bonds (this may be a bit too high).  And, the Government would guarantee a return equal to inflation so anyone's Social Security retirement (SS) account would at least maintain its purchasing power.  At retirement, such SS account would be annuitized so the retirees would not bear anymore investment risk when they can least afford it.<br /><br />Both Kotlikoff and Burns contributed to the excellent financial planning sections.  The entire chapter 12 on the subject is outstanding.  Their recommendations to avoid Wall Street and any professional advisors and save the money to invest yourself is excellent.  They suggest you stick to index funds and invest in several different asset classes.  They suggest just three or four such index funds that cover efficiently the entire investment world.  Those index funds typically charge only 0.15% of assets or only one seventh of actively managed funds.  Yet, the index funds deliver superior results.<br /><br />The authors recommendations on retirement (chapter 13) are very interesting.  They suggest plenty of ways of reducing costs and increasing income including selling a home, renting, moving to a lower cost State or even country.<br /><br />As reviewed this book is really uneven.  Unfortunately, Kotlikoff's fiscal and macroeconomic fallacies brought the average down.  If the two authors had just focused on where they excel (financial planning, retirement strategies), it could have been an excellent book.ard.<br /><br />His health care plan is the Paul Ryan plan for all.

Every birthday and Kwanzaa I purchase one special book for him.  I am in love with Nancy Tillman's books anyway, however, this is the first one I have purchased.  The illustrations are simply beautiful, very soft - kind of like watercolors. If you have a child who likes animals - they will appreciate the illustrations.  Most importantly - the book reads like a poem (not in iambic pentameter or rhyme).  It isn't wordy which lends itself to a warm, whimsical nature.  My favorite part is the very last page which simply reads, \\"You are loved.\\"  This book is very appropriate and of the correct quality (hardback) for gift-giving.  It is very well-suited for younger children or, as in my case, as a special something for a tender-hearted older child.  You can't go wrong.  Enjoy!	2012-05-02

I have worked for network television news for over 30 years, only Mr. Rather has the courage to tell the absolute truth :<br /><br />On the Standards of American Journalism Today<br /><br />\\"American journalism is in crisis, in my opinion, there are a lot of reasons for that, but not the least is what's happened to the business of journalism as well of the practice (of journalism).  There has been the corporatization, the politicization and the trivialization of the news...and in many ways, we in journalism have lost our spine, we've lost our grit, our gut...I see some signs of it getting somewhat better...but we now have a situation where no more than 6, possibly as few as 4, major global corporations, control about 80% or more of our true national circulation (news media)...Very big business... is `in bed' with big government in Washington whether it be Republican or Democratic.  That affects what you see, hear and read in the news, and that is not a very good situation for us.  Because you and I know that a free press, an independent, fiercely independent press is necessarily the red beating heart of  democracy.  When you diminish the standards, when you have this political and business influence, it's not healthy.  Whether you consider yourself a conservative, or progressive or liberal it's not good for the country\\".	2012-05-02

I remember some faint mention of it in history class, but...holy crap.<br /><br />Watson paints an adept picture of a fearful and uncertain America after the ravages of WWI and the flu epidemic that sets the stage for the trial. After introducing us to the world, the country, and the men themselves, Watson launches into a detailed and entertaining description of the events--the payroll murders, the investigation, the trial, the appeals, and finally, the executions. The detail he uses speaks to the excellent research, and the writing, though at times a bit liberal with hyperbolic flourishes, draws the reader in. He entertains, informs, and awakens a great sense of shame and injustice in the reader, as well he should.<br /><br />Watson shows the men for what, as far as anyone can tell, they were: militant anarchists and hardworking men, one a bookish intellectual and the other a devoted family man. Very likely innocent in the crimes they were executed for, but undeniably involved in a terrorist organization, they were neither angels or demons--just men who believed in something. He shows that no one can really know what the two were involved in, but that, without a doubt, justice failed. The trials were riddled with prejudices, the law bent towards a verdict that was determined without influence of the evidence.<br /><br />In short, the book is well-written, engaging, and for the non-scholars and somewhat ignorant (me), quite enlightening.	2012-05-02

This is much more detailed version of the simple starship combat system that is in the Thousand Suns Core rulebook. I really like the detail. The authors were really thinking when they put a simplified version in the core book, for when the players need some sort of short space combat, that flows into the role-playing aspect of the game. Then, they give you the more meaty version in this supplement, for those times, that you want to spend the night doing an all out space combat. Brilliant!<br /><br />This supplement expands the original, more simplified rules in the TS Core books. in a big way. It has Starship creation, combat rules,and a lot of campaign extras that have nothing to do with Starship combat, to add to your TS game.<br /><br />Space Navies: size, purpose and composition of space navies, crew training and positions and responsibilities, skill use and technology aboard ships, effects of FTL technology on campaigns, interstellar law, communications... and more.<br /><br />Chapter 1: All about Space Navies<br />Chapter 2: All about shipboard activities, FTL,etc..<br />Chapter 3: Combat! including put your PCs into the battle.

The Thousand Suns: Starships, is a fantastic addition to the core rules!
