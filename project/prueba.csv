I enjoyed it a lot!  What I liked the most was how it took a tired premise and breathed new life into it by creating an entirely new twist on the zombie mythos.  A definite must read!	2012-05-03

The lessons were easy to understand and easy to teach. Each lesson has a list up front explaining everything you need for the session. This alone is very helpful.<br /><br />As for the lessons, the students in my Sunday School class (11th and 12th graders) are being challenged by new ideas and thoughts. This has led them to really look at their faith and figure out what they truly believe. This alone is essential to them establishing a personal faith and not cling to the faith of their parents.<br /><br />This curriculum is essential to any youth group. They are topics that should be discussed with every senior before they leave high school.<br /><br />How could you pass up on such a formational curriculum for such a great price?<br /><br />- Zach Carpenter<br />Roseburg Church On The Rise	2012-05-03

It was fun going hearing about Mr. Bryan's sexual escapades -- at first.  It was refreshing to have someone who could frequently be very perceptive speak honestly not only about his life, but the sexual escapades and shenanigans he was engaging in.  And to link that behavior with the horrific conditions of his early youth in a ghetto in Jamaica, and more loosely, with the Jamaican cultural socialization which influenced him.  These elements humanized and explained some of his less than noble behavior.<br /><br />However, what becomes extremely obvious as the book goes on (and on and on it does go)is that, even in Mr. Bryan's own words, he suffers from 'dissocial personality disorder,' or some such thing.  Perilously close, it seems to me, to sociopathic behavior.  Even the title, in retrospect, speaks to the sociopaths view of humanity.  Mr. Bryan is a 'passenger', i.e. a person, the woman are 'cabs' -- non-humans.<br /><br />The irony, of course, for anyone who's read the novel is that Mr. Bryan frequently speaks of how the Japanese culture traumatizes and demeans women.  However, he is a flagrant abuser of women -- though he frequently presents himself as the opposite, as one who has nutured these poor women back to health!<br /><br />He has impregnated more than 10 women while in Japan -- and in most case paid or helped to pay for the abortions.  More than 10 women!  All because he enjoys the feel of sex without a condom.  And because he knows that most of the women won't insist that he wear one due to their timidity!  So, in effect, he'd have woman after woman go through the greater trauma of an abortion; and have fetus be terminated (some would even say murdered); and he would even have to pay (in some cases only half) for his temporary pleasure!  This, more than ten times!<br /><br />And let us not forget how he then has his cake and eats it too as he makes out how horrible it is of the Japanese to run an abortion industry, instead of having oral contraceptives more readily available.<br /><br />He also even refers to the women in his writings as cars.  He prefers, he tells the reader, his \\"bentley\\" (Shoko) but the 'ferrari' (Azusa) is sexier and her parents are so accepting of him!<br /><br />The language he uses time and again, in conjunction with the repeated behaviors, indicates that closeness he shares with the sociopath: people are things to be used, manipulated.  People are not people: they are not truly human with feelings and the right to be treated as 'ends in themselves' -- but rather they are trappings, are thigns, to be used and manipulated by the sociopath.<br /><br />Mr. Bryan frequently talks about how he doesn't really love -- indeed, it seems that he doesn't even like very much -- Azusa.  But she's so good looking that he wants to have children with her; while, of course, marrying Shoko (or perhaps converting to Islam -- though he's an atheist -- in the hopes of being able to legally marry both of them).<br /><br />This goes on and on.<br /><br />Again, at first, much of this seemed fun, interesting, a man with hardbreaks coming into his own.  However, this behavior is -- and has been -- going on for years, even into his forites.<br /><br />Yes, there's the 'addiction,' however, I got the distinct impression that Mr. Bryan was being more honest than perhaps he meant to be when he on repeated occasions told the reader about his personality disorder.  He truly has one, it seems.  He may not be a sociopath, but in many respects his 'disorder' is such that other people are things.  For me, to get behind the eyes, so to speak, of a person like that is a frightening experience.  But, pun intended, an 'eye-opener'!<br /><br />It's also curious that Mr. Bryan has, it seems, only female friends.  In part, he would have the reader believe it is because of his greater sensitivity to females and their plight.  He sometimes refers to himself as a 'lesbian in a male's body.'  His sensitivity is hogwash!  Woman form the perfect dovetail for the likes of him:  one, he likes 'tail' and two, he knows that he can manipulate them far more easily than he can men.  These two features make them delectable to him.<br /><br />A minor note.  Much of the book is fairly well written with this curious feature:  there are numerous rather 'lofty' words sprinkled throughout the text.  For example he writes of one woman \\"she tried corybanticly to cloak herself with anything in sight\\" (Yukari; p331).  Now, I have a master's degree in English, but I don't know what the freak \\"corybanticly\\" means.  The point is that too frequently this text is larded with extremely high falutin words, amid, of course, the booty calls, and his petrified rod, etc.<br /><br />Most curious!<br /><br />Anyway, this is in many ways an interesting read: some of the incidents are enjoyable to read; much of the writing is actually pretty good; there are some sharp insights into Japanese culture ( I lived in Japan for a year so I had some access to what he's referring to); there's great awareness generally of culture and its influence (Jamaican, American, Japanese).  There's the fascinating other perspective -- both replusive and fascinating -- of the view from the 'personality disorder'.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this book 3 stars.<br /><br />I hope this review helped.<br /><br />Aloha,<br />paul	2012-05-03

I had been wondering.  As I read this book (borrowed from a neighbor) I learned about beliefs no one in my social milieu had shared with me yet.  I am entirely greatful to learn WHY I am considered incompetent to question national policies.  Thanks for the enlightment and entertainment.	2012-05-03

A further entrant to the popular range of recipe books by the BBC now provides 101 additional cakes and bakes that could add a few kilos or more without trouble to your waistline... and since the recipes look so easy to make as well one cannot rely upon prevarication to help reduce calorific intake.<br />These praiseworthy little books feature the recipe on one side and a full colour photograph on the facing page, put together into a tight little package that gives 101 different dishes for an unbeatable price.<br />Reviewing these books is actually quite hard. One cannot be critical of the approach taken by the entire series as there is nothing that can go wrong (doing a \\"King Alfred\\" not withstanding). . One cannot complain about the breadth of recipes, the price, the appearance, so one might be forced to complain about the sheer tempting nature of the recipes if one has to find something to complain about.<br />Split into six sections - large cakes, fresh fruit cakes, chocolate cakes and bakes, loaf cakes, small cakes and tray bakes and finally muffins and cookies - and backed up by a good little index you can, at-a-glance dig out that favourite recipe, find inspiration based on a particular ingredient or, of course, just browse through and be inspired.<br />Each recipe has even been \\"triple tested\\" by different cooks to ensure that the average home cook will have no problems, something some other cook books could well emulate. So far we have not found a bad book in this series and long may it continue.	2012-05-03
